### Architecture

- BROLANG was primarily built on an **Event-Based Architecture**
- The code has been commented in main.go and api/handler/compiler_handler.go which belonfgs to this architecture.
- On production, this application is working on Client-Server architecture because of this independent student-developer's tight budget, moreover the code has been commented in context/CodeContext.tsx.

### Open Source

- The code itself is self-explanatory and has been well documented in Go-Doc format.
- Contributions, issues and feature requests are welcome. Feel free to check the [issues page](/issues) if you want to contribute.
